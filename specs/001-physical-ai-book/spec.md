No vague descriptions. --- ## Technical Standards The specification must enforce: - Robotics-accurate terminology (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac, VLA) - Real simulation workflows - Valid ROS 2 code (Python & C++) - Valid Isaac Sim snippets - Clear engineering-oriented explanations - Zero hallucinations - Docusaurus-safe MDX formatting - Internal consistency across all modules --- ## Chatbot Integration (Placeholder) Create a single informational page: **Path:** `/physical-ai-book/docs/chatbot-integration.md` Content Requirements: - Purpose of the RAG chatbot - High-level architecture - Note that implementation will come *after* book creation - Placeholder for embedding UI - No backend or SDK code yet --- ## Success Criteria The `/sp.specify` output must guarantee that: - `/sp.plan` can generate a full working Docusaurus project - All MDX files are valid and build without errors - Directory structure exactly matches the constitution - All modules and setup guides are fully defined - No broken links, no duplicates, no missing pages - Content is actionable and technically correct --- ## Output Requirement The final `/sp.specify` output must deliver: - A complete list of every page - Every page’s file path - Every page’s structural components - Full instructions for generating the entire book - A blueprint that allows `/sp.plan` to scaffold the project deterministically"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate Complete Docusaurus Book (Priority: P1)

As a project manager, I want to generate a complete, production-ready Docusaurus book for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" based on the `/sp.constitution` specification, so that it adheres to all defined architectural and content standards and is ready for deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is the core deliverable of the project's first phase. Without it, no other aspects of the book (like the chatbot integration) can proceed.

**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus project can be built locally (`npm install && npm run build`) and served (`npm run serve`), with all pages, content, and navigation rendering correctly. The output guarantees `sp.plan` can generate a full working Docusaurus project, all MDX files are valid, and the directory structure matches the constitution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project's `/sp.constitution` and the detailed `/sp.specify` output, **When** `/sp.plan` is executed, **Then** a deterministic plan for scaffolding the entire Docusaurus book is produced, defining all pages, file paths, and structural components.
2. **Given** the plan generated by `/sp.plan`, **When** `/sp.tasks` is executed, **Then** a detailed list of tasks to generate all MDX files and their content is created, including instructions for cleaning the existing `docs` directory and setting up the new directory structure.
3. **Given** the tasks generated by `/sp.tasks`, **When** `/sp.implement` is executed, **Then** all required MDX files are generated with frontmatter, titles, descriptions, explanations, diagrams (Mermaid), technical details, code examples, labs/assignments, weekly learning outcomes, and evaluation criteria, adhering to technical standards and correct internal linking.
4. **Given** the generated Docusaurus project, **When** `npm run build` is executed, **Then** the build succeeds with zero errors, and all sidebars generate correctly using the specified structure.
5. **Given** the successfully built Docusaurus project, **When** the site is served locally, **Then** all content loads successfully, with no broken links, duplicate pages, missing pages, or empty placeholders.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a code example is syntactically incorrect? The generation process should flag it as an error.
- How does the system handle an invalid file path in the specification? The generation process should report an error and not create the file.
- What if the content generated contains hallucinations? The technical standards (zero hallucinations) should prevent this, and review during `sp.implement` should catch it.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST generate a complete Docusaurus book project structure, including all specified directories and MDX files.
- **FR-002**: Each generated MDX file MUST include a frontmatter, title, description, engineering-focused explanations, diagrams (Mermaid), technical details, workflows, valid code examples (Python, C++, ROS 2, YAML, Isaac scripts), labs/assignments (for modules), and evaluation criteria.
- **FR-003**: All generated content MUST adhere to robotics-accurate terminology, real simulation workflows, valid ROS 2 code, valid Isaac Sim snippets, clear engineering-oriented explanations, and zero hallucinations.
- **FR-004**: The generated files MUST be Docusaurus-safe MDX formatted and maintain internal consistency across all modules.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST create a single informational page for Chatbot Integration at `/physical-ai-book/docs/chatbot-integration.md` with specific content requirements (purpose of RAG chatbot, high-level architecture, note on implementation timeline, placeholder for embedding UI, no backend/SDK code).
- **FR-006**: All files MUST be generated inside the `/physical-ai-book/docs/` directory.
- **FR-007**: The directory structure MUST exactly match the constitution's specified book architecture, using numeric prefixes for ordering.
- **FR-008**: For each top-level directory (e.g., `01-setup-guides`), a `_category_.json` file MUST be created to provide a clean label in the sidebar.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Page**: Represents a single content page in the Docusaurus book. Key attributes: Title, Description, Exact File Path, Page Objectives, Core Topics, Technical Content, Mermaid Diagrams, Code Examples, Assignments / Labs, Weekly Learning Outcomes, Evaluation Criteria.
- **Module**: A top-level section of the book (e.g., ROS 2, Digital Twin). Key attributes: Overview, Weekly Breakdown, Labs, Assignments, Evaluation Criteria.
- **Directory**: A folder within the Docusaurus `docs` structure. Key attributes: Name (with numeric prefix), `_category_.json` for sidebar label.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The `/sp.plan` output can generate a full working Docusaurus project structure.

- **SC-003**: The directory structure exactly matches the constitution's defined book architecture.
- **SC-004**: All modules, setup guides, introduction, references, and chatbot placeholder pages are fully defined and populated with content according to the specification.
- **SC-005**: The generated book contains no broken links, no duplicate pages, and no missing pages.
- **SC-006**: The generated content is actionable and technically correct, adhering to robotics standards.
- **SC-007**: The `/sp.specify` output delivers a complete list of every page, its file path, structural components, and full instructions for generating the entire book.
