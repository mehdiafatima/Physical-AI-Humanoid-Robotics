## Prompt

## Response snapshot

The detailed task list for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Generation" has been created and written to `specs/001-physical-ai-book/tasks.md`. It outlines 30 tasks covering setup, content generation (User Story 1), and polish phases, with identified parallelization opportunities and clear independent test criteria for the MVP.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, dependency-ordered task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book generation, covering setup, content creation, and quality assurance. This task list is ready for /sp.implement.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-physical-ai-book/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run /sp.implement to begin executing the tasks and generating the book content.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully translated the detailed plan and feature specification into an actionable set of discrete tasks, adhering to the specified format and organization by user story. Identified parallelization opportunities to optimize execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during this step.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None. Proceed to implementation phase.
